# login-authentication
Project 1: Something as simple as a website’s login authentication bar (the area where you enter your email and password to log in to the site) is another part of JavaScript’s domain. This is an unassuming project that’s a good idea to master, since just about every website has a login authentication feature. 


Hello World!
 My name is Courtner and I am on a journey back to tech. Right now I am learning javascript. I like long walks on the beach, tacos and crying over techno music.
